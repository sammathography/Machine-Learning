Five Nodes
N1 = Tom
N2 = Harry
N3 = Julian
N4 = Michele N5 = Josephine

Five Edges
e1 = Harry ‘is known by’ Tom
e2 = Julian ‘is co-worker of’ Harry e3 = Michele ‘is wife of’ Harry
e4 = Josephine ‘is wife of’ Tom
e5 = Josephine ‘is friend of’ Michele
==============
A simple text description of a graph
N1 - e1 -> N2 N2 - e2 -> N3 2 - e3 -> N4 N1 - e4 -> N5 N4 - e5 -> N5


A more technical text description of a graph
N1:ToyNode - e1 -> N2:ToyNode
N2 - e2 -> N3:ToyNode //N2 defined above no need to repat it.
N2 - e3 -> N4:ToyNode
N1 - e4 -> N5:ToyNode
N4 - e5 -> N5


Even more technical pseudo-code
N1:ToyNode - ToyRelation -> N2:ToyNode N2 - ToyRelation -> N3:ToyNode
N2 - ToyRelation -> N4:ToyNode
N1 - ToyRelation -> N5:ToyNode
N4 - ToyRelation -> N5
